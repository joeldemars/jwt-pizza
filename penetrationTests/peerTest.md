### Summary

In the course of this deliverable, we learned about how to use pentesting tools (such as Burp suite) to attack a web server. It surprised me how easy it was to find vulnerabilities with rather little effort. Almost any small oversight or poor design choice can be weaponized. It's important to design the system with resilience in mind; when making decisions about how a system will be implemented, the best way to make it secure is to assume that all users will be acting maliciously. Anything as simple as just trusting the requests that the user sends without verifying them against the database or forgetting to authenticate a user on one endpoint can lead to loss of data and money.
